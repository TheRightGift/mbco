        <p>To become a member of MBCON, you have to pass the criteria for membership which is solely based on the excos of the club. After you’ve met the criteria, then you can now fill out our form on our website. When the excos receive the form, a member of our team will reach out to you via email or call to complete your registration process. We’ve made the process so easy.

Now that you know all about joining the newly formed Mercedes-Benz Club of Naija, feel free to join us. </p>
